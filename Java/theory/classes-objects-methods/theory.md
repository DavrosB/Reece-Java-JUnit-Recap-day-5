# Classes

Each class does its own thing (and only that), microservicing

## What they are

Classes as blueprints to create physical things
- A mould for a car

Mould would include everything it needs to know about the car:
- Size
- Shape
- Doors
- Weight 

A mould is not a car, its not a working model of what it is moulding 
A class is not an object, it is a blue print of what the object should do, and what it contains

# Objects

Objects are `instances` of classes, they are the `physical` creation of classes
A lump of steel -> Mould -> Car Door 
Car door is the object 

1 class can create MANY objects 

# Methods

Methods are what the class / object can do

A method is something an Object can do
public static void drive(){
    drivesForward();
}

Classes `generally` can't do methods
Objects can do methods 

# Attributes

Qualities of the class / object, not what it can do
What is the size of the car

int numberOfWheels = 4;

String name = "test_name"
